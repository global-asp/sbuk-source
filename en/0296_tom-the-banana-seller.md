# Tom the banana seller

##
Tom carries a tray of ripe bananas.

##
Tom goes to the market to sell bananas.

##
People at the market are buying fruit.

##
But no one is buying

Tom's bananas.

They prefer to buy fruit from women.

##
"In our community, only women sell fruit," people say. "What kind of a man is this?" people ask.

##
But Tom does not give up.

He calls, "Buy my bananas!

Buy my sweet ripe bananas!"

##
One woman picks up a bunch of bananas from the tray.

She looks at the bananas carefully.

##
The woman buys the bananas.

##
More people come to the stall.

They buy Tom's bananas and eat them.

##
Soon, the tray is empty.

Tom counts the money he earned.

##
Then Tom buys soap, sugar, and bread.

He puts the things in his tray.

##
Tom balances the tray on his head and goes home.
